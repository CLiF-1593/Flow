D:\Development\ProgrammingProject\Tool\Flow\Flow\FileIO.cpp(21,23): warning C4996: 'getenv': This function or variable may be unsafe. Consider using _dupenv_s instead. To disable deprecation, use _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS. See online help for details.
D:\Development\ProgrammingProject\Tool\Flow\Flow\FileIO.cpp(32,43): warning C4996: 'std::filesystem::u8path': warning STL4021: The std::filesystem::u8path() overloads are deprecated in C++20. The constructors of std::filesystem::path provide equivalent functionality via construction from u8string, u8string_view, or iterators with value_type char8_t. You can define _SILENCE_CXX20_U8PATH_DEPRECATION_WARNING or _SILENCE_ALL_CXX20_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS to suppress this warning.
